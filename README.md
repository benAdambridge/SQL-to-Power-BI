The project aims to provide a 2023 sales and customer dashboard for Sandersons & Sons Shoe Shop. 

Sandersons & Sons Shoe Shop uses a database to record their sales automatically when they happen. 

I connected, through PostgreSQL, to the database, and created a bespoke view, to look at customer details and sales made.

Finally, connecting up to this SQL view using Power BI, and visualizing their data.

## Note ##

The SQL database was created by myself using PostgreSQL's querying capabilities to create and then record trial data - guided by Derek Banas' SQL video https://youtu.be/85pG_pDkITY?si=k24T_VNonN0EuEpK. 

The Power BI dashboard then uses this SQL data to visualize sales for Sandersons & Sons Shoe Shop.


'Creating a view for Power BI', demonstrates me creating a bespoke view of all the data I need from the multiple tables in the database in PostgreSQL ready for loading in Power BI.

'Creating table and inserting data', shows one example of many, of how I created the database and the individual connected tables within it, using SQL.
